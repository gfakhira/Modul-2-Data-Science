## **What is SaaS?**
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a business and software delivery model that enables organizations to offer their solution in a low-friction, service-centric approach. The SaaS model relies on agility and operational efficiency as pillars of a business strategy that promotes growth, reach, and innovation. AWS services offer scalable solutions for compute, storage, databases, analytics, and more.

## **Business Problem**
What kind of analysis that we need to do?
Since we've known a brief about Saas as a service for business, we can do **B2B Saas Data Analysis**.<br>
**B2B Saas Data Analysis** itself is **The process determining and tracking that companies does to follow, track, and analyze their performance in various areas to drive business growth.** B2B market research itself is not only gathering data on what potential customers are looking for and what they need. The research can cover everything from brand perception, product fit, customer service requirements, sales and marketing strategies, and more.

It involves taking a sample of your target audience and understanding their motivations and preferences. By researching how your potential audience thinks, feels, and behaves, your strategic planning for attracting your target market will be more effective

# About Project
Through this project I try to analize AWS SaaS Sales with simple B2B approach (product and customer). Analysis made in this project is about finance summary, product, and how discount becomes a factor that influences the sales of a product and its profit. Not only that, how customers can give influences through product repurchas and become one of an aspect influencing the sales of product.
